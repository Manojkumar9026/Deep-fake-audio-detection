# Deep-fake-audio-detection
Thsi is a deep fake audio detection using machine learning 

🎙️ Deepfake Audio Detection
Detect whether an input audio file is real or synthetically generated (deepfake) using machine learning and audio analysis techniques.

🔍 Overview
With the rise of generative AI, deepfake audio poses a serious threat in misinformation, fraud, and impersonation. This project aims to build an efficient and accurate system to detect deepfake audio in real time.

i used four different machine learning model like gradient boosting ,xg boost,svm and random forest adn three features like mfcc amd mel frequency and me sepctogram

Great! Here's an updated and customized README.md template based on your work using four ML models and three audio features (MFCC, Mel Frequency, Mel Spectrogram) for Deepfake Audio Detection:

🎧 Deepfake Audio Detection Using Machine Learning
Detect whether an audio file is real or deepfake using machine learning algorithms trained on key audio features like MFCC, Mel Frequency, and Mel Spectrogram.

📌 Overview
With the increasing misuse of AI-generated voices, detecting deepfake audio has become critical. This project uses classical machine learning algorithms to analyze extracted audio features and classify audio clips as REAL or FAKE.

🧠 Models Used
We evaluated the following ML models:

🌲 Random Forest

💥 Gradient Boosting

⚡ XGBoost

💫 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model was trained and tested on extracted features to determine the most effective classifier for deepfake detection.

🎵 Audio Features Extracted
We used three robust features from audio signals:

MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) – captures the timbral texture.

Mel Frequency – emphasizes perceptually relevant frequency bands.

Mel Spectrogram – visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies.
